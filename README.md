# Automated User Account Creation Script

## Overview

This Bash script automates the creation of user accounts on a Linux system based on input provided in a text file. It reads each line from the input file, where each line specifies a username followed by groups separated by semicolons. The script performs the necessary actions to set up each user account, including password generation, home directory setup, and logging of activities.

## Features

- **Secure Password Handling**: Random passwords are generated securely using `openssl rand` and stored in a file (`PASSWORD_FILE`) with permissions set to 600 for security.
  
- **Logging**: Detailed logs (`LOG_FILE`) track each action performed by the script, including user creation, password assignment, group management, and any errors encountered.

- **Group Management**: If specified, the script creates missing groups and assigns users to these groups as needed.

- **Input File Format**: The script expects an input file (`INPUT_FILE`) where each line follows the format `username;group1,group2,...`. It cleans up input data for consistency.

- **Error Handling**: Checks are in place to prevent duplicate user creation and ensure the input file exists before processing.

## Usage

### Prerequisites

Ensure the script is executed with Bash (`#!/bin/bash`).

### Running the Script

1. Clone the repository to your Linux server.

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

2. Make the script executable.

   ```bash
   chmod +x create_users.sh
   ```

3. Prepare the input file (`users.txt`) with user and group information in the specified format.

   ```plaintext
   john;developers
   jane;testers
   ```

4. Execute the script with the input file.

   ```bash
   ./create_users.sh users.txt
   ```

5. Monitor the logs for details on user account creation.

   ```bash
   sudo less /var/log/user_management.log
   ```

### Notes

- Ensure the script is run with appropriate permissions (`sudo` if necessary) to create users and groups.
  
- Review the log file (`/var/log/user_management.log`) for troubleshooting and tracking script activities.
